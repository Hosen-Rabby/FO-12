                This app concept was my submission for the Adobe Creative Jam x
                Amazon. The goal of this was to create an inclusive interface
                for highschool students looking for volunteering opportunities.
                This app is a fully fledged hub that has all the resources
                highschoolers need to make the most of volunteering.

              Inspired by Amazon’s initiative, your challenge is to design an
              inclusive experience in a third-party mobile app for high school
              students looking for opportunities to fulfill community service
              hours or volunteer to help their local community, no matter what
              their background or ability.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We first began this project by brainstorming potential ideas
                    that would appeal to a younger demographic of students grade
                    8-12.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We then listed all the necessary features that an app of our
                    scale should include without overcomplicating things. This
                    would be beneficial later on as we would have many problems
                    with the information architecture.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We took a look at currently existing apps on the app store
                    that tracked volunteer hours for a bit of competitive
                    analysis.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Finally, we referenced other social media sites that are
                    more common to this younger demographic such as snapchat and
                    instagram.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="brain_facts">
                <p>What we learned</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Our target demographic for this app would be younger than
                    those of other apps that we were accustomed to creating.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    As a result, we made the decisive conclusion that our app’s
                    interface would be totally unique compared to other apps
                    that had similar goals.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Other related apps were incredibly bland and we immediately
                    realized that this industry had so much potential. So a
                    totally unique idea would not be perceived as something out
                    of the blue.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We ascertained a pattern within social media applications
                    and ultimately determined the cause behind their domination
                    of student’s screen time. This was the visually focused
                    design with intuitive controls on a singular, central
                    interface.

                    We tried to balance the amount of functions we were trying
                    to add with some simplicity so that the overall cognitive
                    load on each screen would be minimized.

                  <li>
                    We found that a booking functionality and a chatting
                    functionality were the most essential and we then decided to
                    start there.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We made the landing page of the site a map based page with
                    our mascot as a welcoming penguin. This visually engaging
                    feature differentiated us from the other competitors.

                <p>
                  After outlining our requirements for the low-fidelity
                  wireframes, we then created the high-fidelity prototypes in
                  order to perform user testing. The purpose of this testing
                  before finalizing the app was to find any gaps in my reasoning
                  and challenges with the app design. I asked a mentor and a few
                  highschool students to test the prototype of this app,
                  instructing them to go through the main user flow and voice
                  out their concerns.

                <p>
                  We received feedback that the home page had too many icons and
                  overwhelmed many new users regarding the workflow. We
                  eventually grouped the chat button and the friends button in
                  order to reduce the cognitive overload that users were
                  currently experiencing

                    Users felt that most sections were too different from one to
                    the next. They were struggling to mentally remember where
                    certain things were located and what purpose they served
                    overall. We eventually found a way to make each screen and

                    styling, and grid pattern.

                    making the last item slightly visible so that this would
                    pique the user’s experience, enticing them to scroll and

                  avoided by focusing more on the information architecture as

                  over time as we had done a minimum amount of the information
